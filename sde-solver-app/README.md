# SDE Symbolic Solver Web Application

A web application for symbolic solution of Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) based on the research of Chu-Ching Huang (2011).

## Features

- Symbolic solution of It√¥ and Stratonovich SDEs
- Step-by-step solution display with LaTeX rendering
- Support for linear SDEs and reducible nonlinear SDEs
- Kolmogorov forward equation solutions
- Web-based interface with responsive design
